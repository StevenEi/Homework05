05 Day Planner

## Project Description
For this homework I had to create a day planner that would record a user's appointments during different hour-long blocks of the work day in local storage. The day planner would automatically pull the data from local storage if the tab was closed. The different hour blocks of the day planner should also change color based on whether or not the time period is in the past, present or future. The day planner should also incorporate the Moment API so that the current day is shown in the head. 

## What I Learned
Overall this homework wasn't too hard so I didn't learn anything new specifically. However, it did give me some practice in writing and implementing Jquery and using the third party API Moment.

## Difficulties that I had
I had trouble starting the colorUpdate function which controls the color of the hour blocks based on the time. Once my tutor helped me get the ball rolling though it was a pretty simple if, else if, else statement. The hardest part of it was knowing which two variables (and how to declare them) to compare to get the color to change.
